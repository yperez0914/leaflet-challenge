# leaflet-challenge
<br>
For this project, I created a map visualization of earthquake data using Leaflet. In order to do this, several functions are utilized to create layers and features on the map. The markers are different colors based on earthquake depth and different sizes based on the earthquake's magnitude.Popups were added to detail information such as earthquake magnitude, depth, and location when the user clicks on the marker.A legend is also provided to interpret the marker colors. In order to run the page properly, please make sure you have access to the style.css, logic.js, and index.html files on the repo.
